productive-key
==============

Building a prototype for a idea i have to make me more productive as a developer.  In a nutshell it's a programmable keyboard but cooler (Hopefully).  I tend to bounce back and forth between Mac/Linux/Windows and feel it make me less productive.  When refactoring i tend to use the same processes over and over again... So this is where Productive Key comes in.  Early stages though.
